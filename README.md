# YMH Cube  
  
This script is for sure a work-in-progress but gets the job done. It could benefit from small tweaks if anyone wants to submit a PR.  
  
• Requires ffmpeg  
  
• This code adds a new header frame to each desired mp3 file so they will play correctly on the Inspiration Cube. Add the files you would like to the subdirectories in the input folder; they will be added to the corresponding output folder when processed.  

• This script will also automatically add the files to the external hard drive if you have it inserted into the computer you run the script on. You simply need to rename the drive to whatever you would like and update the `volume_name` variable in the script.  

• As a bonus for YMH (https://ymhstudios.com/yourmomshouse/) fans, I have added the drops and songs I collected into the 'output' folder. More will be added as collect them! If you haven't seen it already, this hack has been featured on episode #579 of the podcast here: https://youtu.be/NmTqUZKaqnU?t=3075
